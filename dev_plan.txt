* Action plan for functional development

1. Identify all hardware to be used, external and internal
  *  import those libraries, and initialize any necessary components via variables & indexes (assigning i2c, ADC, etc.)
2. Define Constants and Variables
  * modulation range?, note frequencies?, keycodes?, sample rate?, buffer size?, ssd1306 display state?
3. Map any necessary hardware to the variable it is going to effect
    * one potentiometer for each segment of envelope? a pot per wave signal generator output?
4. Generate a sample
    * using the inputs from pots/switches/buttons, use those vars to adjust the sample ("processing") - if using a display, update screen with variable data that is applied to the current sample
5. Play the note
    * set note frequency? take modified audio sample and output

* Main Loop
continuously update values from potentiometers/switches/buttons
save a sample state
output sample state
clear sample state
update display

short sleep to protect CPU
